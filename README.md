The Pineapple Website

  The Pineapple is an Irish pub based in Lambeth, London. Over the last 30 years, the friendly family business has built a loyal customer base of locals wanting to escape the busy city. 
  In summer 2016, I began working with the Oâ€™Neills to define a brand, expand their online presence and attract more customers.
  Together, we created a set of goals the new website should achieve, these included: attract more tourists, promote the food menu and encourage more event bookings. All branding work, logo, menu and website design was done by myself and developed manually without a Content Management System.

  Developing The Pineapple website was an exciting opportunity for me to test out some new technologies, including PHPMailer, Google Maps API and Javascript form validation.
